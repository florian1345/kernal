/// Utility-macro to compactly write tests for failing assertions. As an example, consider the
/// following assertion.
///
/// ```norun
/// assert_that!(1).is_equal_to(2);
/// ```
///
/// To test that this assertion fails with the correct message, we would use this macro as follows.
///
/// ```norun
/// assert_fails!((1).is_equal_to(2),
///   expected it "to equal <2>"
///   but it "was <1>");
/// ```
///
/// # Arguments
///
/// * $input: The expression tested by the assertion which is expected to fail. Put inside
///   parentheses to ensure it is isolated from the rest (`.` would otherwise be interpreted as part
///   of the expression). In the example, this would be `1`.
/// * $assertion: The identifier of the assertion-method to test. In the example, this would be
///   `is_equal_to`.
/// * args: A parameter list to supply to the assertion expected to fail. In the example, this would
///   be `2`
/// * $expected_it: A string literal containing the expected part of the error message that comes
///   after `expected: <...> `. The first part of this line is asserted to be as the `Failure`
///   struct defines, with appropriate expression text. In the example, this would be
///   `"to equal <2>"`.
/// * $but_it: A string literal containing the expected part of the error message that comes
///   after `but:      it <...> `. In the example, this would be `"was <1>"`.
