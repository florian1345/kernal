//! Kernal allows you to use fluent assertions in Rust tests. That is, instead of writing
//! `assert_eq!(my_vec.len(), 10)`, you can write `assert_that!(my_vec).has_length(10)`, making your
//! tests more readable and enabling the framework to provide more expressive error messages. Kernal
//! aims to provide specialized assertions for as many commonly tested properties as possible.
//!
//! # Writing an assertion
//!
//! When you write an assertion over a value, you always start with`assert_that!(<your value>)`. The
//! [assert_that] macro gives you an instance on which you can call associated functions to make
//! your assertions. To be able to use these assertions, the specialized extension traits must be
//! imported, such as [StringAssertions](string::StringAssertions) when using special assertions for
//! [String]s. You can glob-import the [prelude] module to get all imports you need to write every
//! assertion supported by Kernal.
//!
//! ```
//! use kernal::prelude::*;
//!
//! assert_that!("hello world").contains("world");
//! ```
//!
//! # Chaining
//!
//! Every assertion returns the same asserter instance to continue writing assertions on the same
//! value. In addition, some extension traits define mapping methods that manipulate the data in
//! some way and return asserter instances on the new data.
//!
//! ```
//! use kernal::prelude::*;
//!
//! assert_that!("almost")
//!     .has_char_length(6)
//!     .ends_with("most")
//!     .to_chars()
//!     .is_sorted_in_strictly_ascending_order();
//! ```
//!
//! # Creating custom assertions
//!
//! `kernal` allows the creation of custom assertions to test instances of your types in a more
//! natural way. To do this, create a new trait which has a method for your assertion. This will be
//! called on the output of the [assert_that] macro. In order to enable its usage, you need to
//! implement your trait on the [AssertThat] with the type you want to test as a type parameter.
//! Import the [AssertThatData] trait to get access to the tested data. It is not provided in the
//! [prelude] module in order to avoid presenting these methods every time the user looks for an
//! assertion. You can use the [Failure] struct to compose an error message consistent with the
//! `kernal` crate. The example below demonstrates this process.
//!
//! ```
//! use kernal::{AssertThat, AssertThatData, Failure};
//! use kernal::prelude::*;
//!
//! // Our type for which we want to write assertions.
//! struct Vector2f32 { x: f32, y: f32 }
//!
//! // The custom assertion trait we will later implement on `AssertThat`.
//! trait Vector2f32Assertions {
//!     // The custom assertion we want to supply. It is recommended to take an owned `self` and
//!     // return the same instance to support chaining.
//!     fn has_euclidean_norm(self, expected_norm: f32, epsilon: f32) -> AssertThat<Vector2f32>;
//! }
//!
//! impl Vector2f32Assertions for AssertThat<Vector2f32> {
//!     fn has_euclidean_norm(self, expected_norm: f32, epsilon: f32) -> AssertThat<Vector2f32> {
//!         // We get our data with `self.data()`, supplied by `AssertThatData`
//!         let vector = self.data();
//!         let actual_norm = (vector.x * vector.x + vector.y * vector.y).sqrt();
//!
//!         if (actual_norm - expected_norm).abs() > epsilon {
//!             // Here we must fail - using the `Failure` struct
//!             Failure::new(&self)
//!                 .expected_it(format!("to have a euclidean norm within <{}> of <{}>",
//!                     epsilon, expected_norm))
//!                 .but_it(format!("was <({}, {})>, with a euclidean norm of <{}>",
//!                     vector.x, vector.y, actual_norm))
//!                 .fail()
//!         }
//!
//!         // Here the test passes, so we return `self` for chaining
//!         self
//!     }
//! }
//!
//! assert_that!(Vector2f32 { x: 3.0, y: 4.0 }).has_euclidean_norm(5.0, 0.01);
//! assert_that!(|| assert_that!(Vector2f32 { x: 3.0, y: 3.0 }).has_euclidean_norm(5.0, 0.01))
//!     .panics();
//! ```
//!
//! # Notes on performance
//!
//! Should you write assertions on large amounts of data, the standard assertions may become a
//! bottleneck. For some use cases, there are specialized assertions that use additional trait
//! bounds to improve performance. These are available under the [fast_prelude] module. See below
//! for an example on how to use it.
//!
//! ```
//! use kernal::prelude::*;
//! use kernal::fast_prelude::*;
//!
//! assert_that!([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
//!     .contains_all_of_using_hash([2, 3, 4])
//!     .contains_none_of_using_ord([6, 7, 8]);
//! ```
//!
//! If no sufficiently performant assertion is available, you should consider falling back to
//! standard assertions.
